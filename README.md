# TrafficCrashAnalysis
A data analysis project investigating the causes of traffic accidents in Chicago.
To run the web application, use the following command:  
python -m streamlit run web.py

## Project Idea:
I want  to conduct a data analysis on the causes of traffic accidents, which will include the following components:

1. Use the Chicago Open Data API to obtain comprehensive information on traffic accidents.

2. I will examine whether lighting conditions have a significant impact on the occurrence of traffic accidents. This analysis will be accompanied by visualizations to illustrate any identified patterns or trends.

3. I will analyze whether certain types of trafficways are more prone to specific categories of crashes. This will help identify if particular trafficway configurations are associated with higher risks for certain crash types.

4. I will evaluate whether the frequency of traffic accidents is influenced by varying speed limits and the presence or absence of traffic signals at intersections. 

## Project Plan  

- **By the end of Week 4**: Obtain and explore traffic accident data provided by the Chicago Open Data API. Clean and preprocess the data to ensure its usability.  
- **By the end of Week 5**: Conduct an initial exploratory data analysis to identify key trends and potential correlations. Generate basic statistical summaries of the data and enable querying specific accident details using Crash_Record_ID.  
- **By the end of Week 6**: Analyze the impact of lighting conditions on traffic accidents. Create visualizations such as bar charts and heatmaps to illustrate trends.  
- **By the end of Week 7**: Investigate the relationship between different types of trafficways and specific categories of crashes. Identify patterns and present findings through visual analysis.  
- **By the end of Week 8**: Assess the influence of speed limits and traffic signals on accident frequency. Develop statistical models or visualization tools to support conclusions.  
- **Final Steps**: Compile all analysis results into a complete report or presentation. Enhance visualization quality.  

## Data Source  

The dataset will be retrieved from the [Chicago Open Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Crashes/85ca-t3if).
