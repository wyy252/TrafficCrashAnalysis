# TrafficCrashAnalysis
A data analysis project investigating the causes of traffic accidents in Chicago.

I want  to conduct a data analysis on the causes of traffic accidents, which will include the following components:

1. Use the Chicago Open Data API to obtain comprehensive information on traffic accidents.

2. I will examine whether lighting conditions have a significant impact on the occurrence of traffic accidents. This analysis will be accompanied by visualizations to illustrate any identified patterns or trends.

3. I will analyze whether certain types of trafficways are more prone to specific categories of crashes. This will help identify if particular trafficway configurations are associated with higher risks for certain crash types.

4. I will evaluate whether the frequency of traffic accidents is influenced by varying speed limits and the presence or absence of traffic signals at intersections.
